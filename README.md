# Switch-Toggle-TCA-SwiftUI
Demo of Switch Toggle with On and Off Color using Swift UI and TCA.

According to Apple, a Toggle is a control that switches between the on and off state.Â 
A Toggle can have a ToggleStyle that can be any type of component that falls in the previous definition.
A Toggle with the Switch Style is very popular in all branches of Frontend Development. In this post I aim to explain how to override the on and off color of a Toggle similar to the demo above in Swift UI.
